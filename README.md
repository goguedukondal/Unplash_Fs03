I have used React hooks like useEffect for handling side Effects like Fetch.
Using fetch methode i have fetched data from Unplash API .
After Fetched data from i have used useState hook for assigning data to satate variable so that the data can be updatable later and re-rendering the component.
I have used map method for mapping array and displaying in my UI.
